/*
  Example of unsat-core highlighting in Forge. It's important that you're running 
  Forge 3.4 or later with the latest VSCode extension to get highlighting. It's also 
  important to keep in mind that there are corner cases where the core will contain 
  formulas that are not mapped to a location in the model. This is rare, but happens 
  in Alloy, too. (Alloy will not give a core at all in these cases; Forge will print 
  a combination of:
    (1) locations in the source; AND 
    (2) constraints that aren't directly mapped back.)

  If you're using the VSCode extension, a core will be underlined in red. 
  If you're _not_ using the VSCode extension, you'll see the location info in the terminal. 
  Note that, if you're running in VSCode, you may need to click "continue" to see the core
    for a "run" command.
