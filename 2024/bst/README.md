# Binary Search Trees 

## Files 

* `bst_1.frg`: a Relational Forge model of binary trees 
* `bst_2.frg`: a Relational Forge model of binary search trees (BSTs), using two different invariants
* `bst_3.frg`: a Temporal Forge model of search-descent through a BST, trying both invariants
* `bst_4.frg`: a Temporal Forge model of search-descent through a BST, checking correctness
* `bst.js`: visualization script for the Relational Forge models
* `bst_temporal.js`: visualization script for the Temporal Forge model

There are also 2 example visualization images:
* `v1_success.png`: shows a successful binary-search run;
* `v2_failure.png`: shows a failed binary_search run (caused by a bad invariant).

## TODO

* Would be nice to have an alternative visualization that spaced the values out properly on a number line. This would make it easier to see the invariant(s).
